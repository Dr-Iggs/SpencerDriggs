    "text": "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique used to simplify complex data by reducing the number of variables while retaining most of the original information. In other words, it helps to identify the most important patterns or relationships in large datasets by transforming them into a set of linearly uncorrelated variables, known as principal components.\nPCA works by identifying the underlying structure of the data and extracting the directions of maximum variance, which are the principal components. Each principal component is a linear combination of the original variables, and they are orthogonal to each other, meaning that they are uncorrelated. The first principal component captures the most significant variation in the data, and subsequent components capture decreasing amounts of variation. By selecting the appropriate number of principal components, we can reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining the essential information.\nIn this data science project, I used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to visualize and explore the similarity of various counties in the United States based on a set of demographic metrics including th following:\nThe primary utility of using PCA in this context is to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining as much information as possible. By doing so, we can efficiently examine patterns and relationships among counties in a lower-dimensional space.\nFor each of these data, I applied PCA to transform the original high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space that still captures most of the variation present in the original dataset.\nBy plotting the first two or three principal components on a 2D scatter plot, we can visualize the relationships among counties based on their transformed coordinates. This allows us to identify clusters of similar counties, outliers, or any other interesting patterns. In the code, I also highlighted a specific county (represented by highlighted_area), making it easier to identify its position relative to other counties in the reduced-dimensional space.\nAdditionally, I created a bar chart displaying the proportion of variance explained by each principal component, which helps to determine the optimal number of components to retain for further analysis or modeling.\nThe use of PCA in this project allows us to effectively summarize the complex, high-dimensional relationships between counties, making it easier to identify patterns and interpret the data.\nCode\n# Import\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go"

    "text": "General Social Survey\nThe General Social Survey (GSS) is a nationally representative survey of American adults that has been conducted since 1972. The GSS is conducted by the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago, and it is widely considered to be one of the most important sources of data on trends in American attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors.\n\n\nCode\n# df_raw &lt;- readxl::read_excel(\"posts/usa_christian/GSS.xlsx\")\n\ndf_raw &lt;- readxl::read_excel(\"GSS.xlsx\")\n\n\nRise of ‘None’\nOne of the key findings of the GSS is that Christianity in the United States is in decline. In the early 1970s, around 90% of Americans identified as Christian, but by 2020, that number had dropped to around 70%. This decline is particularly pronounced among young adults, with only around half of adults under the age of 30 identifying as Christian.\nOne of the main reasons for this decline is the rise of the “Nones” - a term used to describe people who do not identify with any particular religion. The number of Nones in the United States has been steadily increasing over the past few decades, and by 2020, around one in four Americans identified as Nones.\n\n\nCode\nf = df_raw %&gt;%\n  filter(str_detect(as.character(age), \"^[0-9]+$\")) %&gt;% \n  mutate(year = plyr::round_any(as.numeric(year), 10)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(across(everything(), ~replace(., . %in% c(\"Protestant\",\"Catholic\",\"Orthodox-christian\") , \"Christian\"))) %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(everything(), ~replace(., . %in% c(\"Buddhism\",\"Hinduism\",\"Other eastern religions\",\"Inter-nondenominational\",\"Native american\",\"Other\",\"Muslim/islam\") , \"Other\"))) %&gt;%\n  group_by(year, relig) %&gt;% \n  count() %&gt;%\n  filter(!relig %in% c(\".n:  No answer\", \".d:  Do not Know/Cannot Choose\",\".s:  Skipped on Web\")) %&gt;% \n  group_by(year) %&gt;% \n  mutate(percent = round(n/sum(n),5)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(percent_label = (round(n/sum(n),2))*100) %&gt;% \n  mutate(percent_label = percent_label %&gt;%  as.character() %&gt;% paste0(\"%\")) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x=as.numeric(year), y = percent, color = relig)) + \n  geom_line(linewidth = 1)+\n  geom_point(size = 3.5) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Percent\",\n    color = \"Religion\",\n    title = \"Percent Religon Over Time\"\n  ) +\n  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(aes(label = percent_label)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +\n  theme_bw()\n\nf %&gt;% ggplotly()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Christians\nWhile Christianity as a whole is in decline, the decline has not been evenly distributed across different denominations. Catholicism has remained relatively stable, with the proportion of Catholics in the U.S. population staying around 30% since the 1970s. On the other hand, the proportion of Protestants has seen a slight decline, dropping from around 55% in the 1970s to around 45% in 2020.\nOther branches of Christianity, such as Mormonism, Jehovah’s Witnesses, and Eastern Orthodoxy, have seen an increase in recent years. By 2020, these denominations made up around 5% of the U.S. population, a significant increase from their representation in the 1970s.\n\n\nCode\nchristian_vector &lt;- c('PROTESTANT','CATHOLIC','CHRISTIAN','ORTHODOX-CHRISTIAN') %&gt;% tolower()\n\nf = df_raw %&gt;%\n  filter(str_detect(as.character(age), \"^[0-9]+$\")) %&gt;% \n  mutate(year = plyr::round_any(as.numeric(year), 10)) %&gt;% \n  filter(tolower(relig) %in% christian_vector) %&gt;% \n  mutate(across(everything(), ~replace(., . ==  \"Orthodox-christian\" , \"Christian\"))) %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(everything(), ~replace(., . ==  \"Christian\" , \"Other\"))) %&gt;% \n  group_by(year, relig) %&gt;% \n  count() %&gt;% \n  group_by(year) %&gt;% \n  mutate(percent = round(n/sum(n),5)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(percent_label = (round(n/sum(n),2))*100) %&gt;% \n  mutate(percent_label = percent_label %&gt;%  as.character() %&gt;% paste0(\"%\")) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x=as.numeric(year), y = percent, color = relig)) + \n  geom_line(linewidth = 1)+\n  geom_point(size = 3.5) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Percent\",\n    color = \"Denomination\",\n    title = \"Percent Christian Denomination Over Time\"\n    ) +\n  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(aes(label = percent_label)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +\n  theme_bw()\n\nf %&gt;% ggplotly()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother aspect of the decline of Christianity in the United States is the weakening of its strength within the population. This can be seen in the decreasing participation in religious practices such as church attendance.\nAccording to the GSS, the proportion of general Christians who do not attend church has increased from 15% in 1970 to 23% in 2020. Additionally, the proportion of Christians who attend church weekly has declined from 41% in 1970 to 36% in 2020. However, the proportion of Christians who attend church either monthly or less frequently has remained relatively stable.\nThis decline in church attendance is particularly pronounced among young Christians. The proportion of young Christians who attend church weekly or more frequently has decreased in all categories, except for the “seldom” category in which young Christians increased from 23% in 1970 to 45% in 2020.\nTechnical Note: This code is using the tidyverse and patchwork library to analyze and create a plot of church attendance among Christians over time. The code first filters the dataframe to only include rows where the “age” column contains numeric values, and then converts the “age” and “year” columns to numeric format.

Among all Christian denominations, the Catholic Church appears to be the one that has been most affected by the decline in attendance.\nAccording to the GSS, weekly attendance among Catholics has decreased significantly since 1970. Among general Catholics, weekly attendance dropped from 53% to 27% during this time period. Similarly, weekly attendance among Catholic youth has also decreased, declining from 40% in 1970 to 15% in 2020.\nHowever, the decline in attendance has not been limited to weekly attendance. The proportion of Catholics who attend church seldom or less frequently has also increased. Seldom attendance increased from 11% in 1970 to 26% in 2020.

The data shows that the proportion of Christians in the U.S. population has dropped from around 90% in the early 1970s to around 70% in 2020.\nThe decline of Christianity is also reflected in the weakening of its strength within the population, as seen in the decreasing participation in religious practices such as church attendance. The proportion of general Christians who do not attend church has increased from 15% in 1970 to 23% in 2020 and the proportion of Christians who attend church weekly has declined from 41% in 1970 to 36% in 2020. However, the proportion of Christians who attend church either monthly or less frequently has remained relatively stable.\nWhen looking at different Christian denominations, the decline of Protestant Christianity appears to be less pronounced than that of Christianity as a whole. The proportion of Protestants who attend church weekly has remained around 35% since 1970, and weekly attendance for both general Protestants and young Protestants actually increased slightly. On the other hand, the Catholic Church appears to be the one that has been most affected by the decline in attendance. Among general Catholics, weekly attendance dropped from 53% to 27% during this time period, and the youth seldom attendance doubled from 12% to 24% in 2020.\nThe term “Chreaster” is defined as such: “A Christian who does not frequently attend church, attending only on the major holidays of Christmas and Easter.” (Wiktionary) Chreasters have been on the increase especially among younger Christians and Catholics.\nWhile this blog post does not try to explain the ‘why’ in this phenomenon, there are several factors that readers can probably think of that have led to this decline. Some of the possible factors include the increasing secularization of American society, the rise of social media and the internet, the growing diversity of American society, the sexual abuse scandals that have plagued the Catholic Church, and the loss of trust and credibility among Catholics."

This can be seen in the decreasing participation in religious practices such as church attendance.\nAccording to the GSS, the proportion of general Christians who do not attend church has increased from 15% in 1970 to 23% in 2020. Additionally, the proportion of Christians who attend church weekly has declined from 41% in 1970 to 36% in 2020.

    "text": "For my machine learning final project, I built a model to document the Pentagon Papers. It scans the pages and displays the relationships between all the players in the Vietnam War. I finished the class with an A.\nInvestigative journalism teams work with massive text datasets and have to parse through to find which pages are most valuable. This works fine manually for small projects, but some reports cover thousands or even millions of documents. For my project, I’ve used spaCy’s Named Entity Recognition tool to find the locations, organizations and people mentioned within the Pentagon Papers."

Entities might appear together for many reasons, not always because they have a shared goal and strategy, so building accusations or creating a narrative without reading the documents would be unfounded.  However, building a tool like this will be very useful for parsing huge documents. The Pandora papers was over 6 million pages and this can help people trying to hold others accountable for unscrupulous behavior.  It would also be useful to run this on the whole document, because I only grabbed sections of the whole thing. There might be some bias towards the early or middle parts of the war and investigation, without taking into account the development of the war.  My post-graduation goal is to work in data journalism, and I’m hoping that work like this can continue to be a part of my life."
